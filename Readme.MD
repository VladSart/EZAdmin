# What is this for?

This is just a page where I collect my scripts that I use on the regular basis to work on clients machines to make my life easier.
It's targeted towards Windows and M365 Administration sometimes using the Graph API.

Of course, machines that are behaving eratically can get worst or better depending on the dependencies of the thing you're dealing with.

Nothing is ever guaranteed in IT so use at your own risk. Which you're going to do anyways, so at least give it a shot
